title: What NASA find makes a successful team
metaDescription: What NASA find makes a successful team
---
Few teams are tested in the way that NASA space crews are. To prepare for upcoming missions - including 30+ month missions to mars - NASA (and associated resources) conduct extensive behavioral analysis to build predictive models of how teams will perform. 

One key finding is that tension and conflict are inevitable, and can ultimately lead to a stronger team. NASA’s research finds that it’s not so much that happy teams are successful, as that successful teams are happy. Nothing bonds a team like finding success even if there are some bumps along the way.

And the most important role? The clown. Someone able to identify and then defuse tension with humor. Using humor effectively requires deep empathy.
